# 🎞️ DX Code Generator

A simple browser-based tool for generating **DX codes** (the silver & black conductive patches on 35 mm film canisters).  
Select an **ASA/ISO speed**, **frame count**, and **exposure latitude (push/pull)**, and the app will render the correct DX pattern.  
You can then export the result as a **gapless PNG** or **SVG** image for printing or reference.
